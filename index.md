### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

   During this lab we had to create the output of condiments to create our sandwich. What I liked about this lab
   was that we were able to choose the type of condiment we wanted and the result would be our sandwich. 
   It was crazy to see how the program was able to produce what we wanted just by simply choosing the types of condiments we wanted. 
   
* Lab 8
  
  During this lab we mostly learned about the idea ASCII which involved the creation of animations. 
  The part that got my attention the most was part 3 which showed me how to implement ASCII to create an animation that I wanted. 
  I enjoyed this part because i've always wondered how the animations are created through programs and now I understood a gist of it which amazed me.

* Lab 12

  What I enjoyed most about this lab was the ending result, specifically the end of part 2. During this part we were able to initialize words to colors.
  And making gifs using letters. This was amusing to me because I've never done this before and realizing how fun this was made me enjoy what I was doing.
